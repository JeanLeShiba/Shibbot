# Shibbot

## Features

### Moderation

Shibbot will help you moderate your server efficiently : it has all the classics moderation commands (there is a lot of them, really), such as `kick`, `tempmute`, `ban`, ya know, the basic ones.
But it also has less popular ones : `multiban`, `multikick`, `softban` to more flexibility while you sanction a member (abusively or not haha).

That's a good feature isn't it ? Nah ?
Then let's hop to the next one :

### Fun and entertainement

**Memes :**

Get the hottes memes from Reddit everyday with the `meme` (or `nmeme` for nsfw content) command, the bot scrap memes everyday to the Reddit API so they're fresh as... as... ice ? Dunno I lack inspiration.

**Images :**

Want to "awwww" in front of cute animals pictues with your friends (if you have some) ? Then the bot has shibes, cats, birds, foxes just for you !

**Free nitro :**

Gives you a nitro code that comes straight from the depths of the darkweb. Is it illegal ? Don't worry about that.

**Stupid commands :**

There is some wierd commands, like `piss` or `twitter`, I have absolutely no ideas what they exist neither what they do. Maybe you should try them out.
