# Features

### Moderation

Shibbot will help you moderate your server(s) efficiently : it has all the classics moderation commands (there is a lot of them, really), such as `kick`, `tempmute`, `ban`, you know, the basic ones.
But it also has less popular ones : `nuke` (try it, it's really funny), `multikick`, `softban` to more flexibility while you sanction a member (abusively or not haha, we don't care).

**Memes :**

Get the hotest memes from Reddit everyday with the `meme` (or `nmeme` for nsfw content) command, the bot scraps memes everyday to the Reddit so they're fresh as... as... ice ? Dunno we're in lack of inspiration.

**Images :**

Want to "awwww" in front of cute animals pictues with your friends (if you have some) ? Then the bot has shibes, cats, birds, foxes just for your needs !

**Free nitro :**

Gives you a nitro code that comes straight from the depths of the darkweb. Is it illegal ? Don't worry about that.

What's that ?**

There is some wierd commands, like `piss` or `twitter`, we have absolutely no ideas why they exists neither what they do. Maybe you should try them out.
